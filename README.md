## 1. User Experience <a name="user-experience"></a>
### 1.1. User Stories <a name="user-stories"></a>
## First Time Visitor Goals

These are the key goals and expectations of first-time users visiting the JavaScript Quiz App:

-  **Join Fun Quiz App**  
  I want to join fun quiz App online and improve my general knowledge anytime, anywhere.

-  **Device Compatibility**  
  I want the site to work well on my phone, tablet, or computer.

-  **Simple Navigation**  
  I want the site to be easy to use and simple to move around.

## 2. Design <a name="design"></a>
### 2.1. Colour Scheme <a name="colour-scheme"></a>
I chose a simple and limited colour palette to avoid overwhelming users
I have used #fff & #ffff as the primary and secondary colours used for background color.
I have used #0075ff  submit button, spans and correct answer.

### 2.2. Typography <a name="typography"></a>
Google Fonts was used to import the chosen fonts for use in the site.
This project uses Google Fonts to enhance the typography and visual appeal of the quiz app. The following fonts have been imported:
The fonts are imported in the `style.css` file using the `@import` rule:

- **Inconsolata**
- **Montserrat**
- **Raleway**
- **Roboto**
- **Work Sans**

### How Fonts Are Integrated
### 2.3. Imagery <a name="imagery"></a>
Since the website is named "The Quiz App," I chose not to use an image for the page background. Instead, I opted for a blue color scheme to evoke the atmosphere of a pub quiz.
